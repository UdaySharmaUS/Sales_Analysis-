# Sales_Analysis-

ABOUT:

We're diving into a project that uses Python's Pandas and Matplotlib. Our goal? To unravel insights from a year's worth of sales data from an electronics store. This treasure trove contains a wealth of transactions, showcasing purchases across different months, product types, costs, purchase addresses, and more.


We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

1-Drop NaN values from DataFrame.
2-Removing rows based on a condition.
3-Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype).
4-Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. 


In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

Q1-What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
Q2-What city sold the most product?
Q3-What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
Q4-What products are most often sold together?
Q5-What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:


*Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat).
*Adding columns.
*Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str).
*Using the .apply() method.
*Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis.
*Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results.
*Labeling our graphs.
